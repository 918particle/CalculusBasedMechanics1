\section{Electric Charge and Electric Fields}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (a) A certain lightning bolt moves 40.0 C of charge.  To how many electrons does this correspond? (b) Suppose a speck of dust in an oil drop experiment\footnote{A great paper topic, by the way: the Millikan oil drop experiment.} has  $10^{12}$  protons in it and has a net charge of -5.00 nC (a very large charge for a small speck). How many electrons does it have?\\ \vspace{1cm}
\item (a) Two charges exert $F_{\rm C} = 5.00$ N of force on each other. What will $F_{\rm C}$ be if the distance between them triples? (b) If one charge is $1$ nC, and the other is $2$ nC, what is the distance between them if $F_{\rm C} = 5.00$ N? \\ \vspace{1cm}

The classic Millikan oil drop experiment was the first to measure accurately the electron charge. Oil drops were suspended against the gravitational force by a vertical electric field. (See Fig. \ref{fig:mill}.) The drops have radius $1.0 \mu$m, and a density of 920 kg/m$^3$. (a) Find the weight of the drop. (b) If the drop has a single excess electron, find the electric field strength needed to balance its weight. \\ \vspace{1.75cm}
\item Suppose three electrons are arranged in an equilateral triangle 0.1 nm on a side (see Fig. \ref{fig:tri}).  (a) What is the electric field \textbf{vector} at the location of the top charge? (b) Where is the electric field zero?

\item (a) Using Coulomb's Law, show that the electric field at point P in Fig. \ref{fig:line} is (a) strictly in the vertical direction $\hat{k}$, (b) is proportional to $1/z$ if the line of charge is infinite.  (c) \textbf{Bonus:} use Gauss' law to derive the electric field assuming a cylindrical Gaussian surface as the $\vec{A}$ piece.

\section{Potential Energy and Voltage}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the electric field across an 10.00 nm thick membrane if (a) the voltage across it is 50 mV? You may assume a uniform electric field. (b) Suppose this cell membrane is part of a nerve cell.  How much energy would an electron gain if dropped through the 50 mV voltage and accelerated across the cell freely?  Express your anser in electron-Volts (eV). \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item \textbf{Think back to the PhET simulations of parallel lines of charge.}  Suppose a parallel plate capacitor is formed from a positive plate and a negative plate of charge.  The plates' areas $A$ are the same, and the plates' charges ($\pm Q$), and charge densities ($\pm Q/A = \pm \sigma$) are the same as well. (a) Write the expression for the electric field between the plates? (b) Suppose $Q = 1$ nC, and $A = 10$ mm$^2$.  What is the value of the electric field between the plates?  (c) Suppose 0 volts corresponds to the location of the negative plate.  Draw the voltage as a function of distance between the plates.  (d) What is the voltage near the positive plate, if the plates are are separated by a distance $d = 1$ mm? \\ \vspace{1.75cm}

\section{Capacitors}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the capacitance of the capacitor in the previous problem? \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item (a) Consider the same capacitor again, and suppose a second identical capacitor is connected \textit{in parallel} with it.  What is the total capacitance? (b) How much charge would the pair of capacitors store if the voltage across them was 5 volts? \\ \vspace{1.5cm}
\item How much energy in Joules would this charge have if it was all put to work?
