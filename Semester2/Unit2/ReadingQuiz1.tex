\item Consider Fig. \ref{fig:hill}.  Suppose the mass $m$ rolls down a hill from a height of 30 meters.  Neglecting the effects of friction, what will be the final velocity?  \textit{Hint: you do not need to know the mass.} \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Consider Fig. \ref{fig:hill}.  Suppose the charge is $q = 1 \mu$C, and the voltage is 12 V.  (a) What is the potential energy before the charge is released? (b) If the charge has a mass of $10^{-6}$ kg, what is the final speed of the charge? \\ \vspace{1.5cm}
\item What is the minimum voltage barrier required to \textit{stop} the charge from moving?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: 6 V
\item B: 10 V
\item C: 12 V
\item D: 15 V
