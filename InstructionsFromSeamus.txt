Jordan, the link above will take you to the website for PHYS150 from 2014. Hopefully this will give you an idea of the material covered and the activity-based pedagogy. I have also enclosed a PDF of the handouts etc. that I used in the class that year. If you have questions please do not hesitate to contact me. Of course you do not have to use the exact same activities that I do but we should try to cover the same material and we do want the course taught in this interactive manner with students working in groups most of the time.
 
So enjoy!
