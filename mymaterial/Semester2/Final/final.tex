\item Definition of electric flux: $\phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A}$.

\item Voltage and electric field, one dimension, uniform field: $|E| = - \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta x}$.
\item Voltage and electric field, general case: $\vec{E} = -\nabla V$.
\item Ohm's Law: $V = IR$.

In Fig. \ref{fig:trans} (left) a \textit{transformer} is depicted.  The gray square represents an iron core which ensures that the magnitude of the magnetic flux through the left solenoid \textbf{is identical to} the magnetic flux on the right solenoid.  Both solenoids are $L = 5$ cm long.  Suppose the left solenoid has $N_L = 500$ turns, and the right solenoid has $N_R = 1000$ turns.  Let the induced emf in the left solenoid be $v_L$, and the induced emf in the right solenoid be $v_R$.  Show that
\begin{equation}
\frac{v_L}{N_L} = \frac{v_R}{N_R}

\item Suppose the current changes in the left solenoid of Fig. \ref{fig:trans} at a rate of 100 A s$^{-1}$.
