\section{Unit 4 Review}

\begin{frame}{Unit 4 Review}
Suppose a bundle of wires is carrying current along what we call the $\hat{z}$ direction.  Each wire runs along the z-axis and they are close enough to ignore the fact that the volume of each wire prevents it from being exactly on the z-axis.  One wire carries +2.0 A, another carries +1.5 A, and a third carries -0.5 A.  What is the B-field strength at a distance of 1 cm away in the x-y plane?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: 6 Gauss
\item B: 0.6 Gauss
\item C: 6 Tesla
\item D: 0.6 Tesla
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unit 4 Review}
Suppose a loop of current exists in the x-y plane, and a uniform B-field is in the $\hat{z}$ direction.  Which of the following will occur?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: The loop will not rotate - there is no torque.
\item B: The loop will rotate 180 degrees - there is torque.
\item C: The loop will rotate 90 degrees - there is torque.
\item D: The loop will rotate -90 degrees - there is negative torque.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:}
A square coil has sides 0.25 m long and is tightly wound with 200 turns of wire. The resistance of the coil 5.0 Ohms. The coil is placed in a spatially uniform magnetic field that is directed perpendicular to the face of the coil and whose magnitude is decreasing by −0.040 T/s. (a) What is the magnitude of the emf induced in the coil? (b) What is the magnitude of the current circulating through the coil?

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law}
\small
\textbf{Example:}
A magnetic field B is directed outward perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of radius r = 0.50 m.  The field is cylindrically symmetrical with respect to the center of the coil, and its magnitude decays exponentially according to
\begin{equation}
B(t) = B_0 \exp(-a t)
\end{equation}
with $B_0 = 1.5$ T and $a = 5.0$ s$^{-1}$.  (a) Calculate the emf induced in the coil at the times $t_0 = 0$, $t_1 = 0.05$, and $t_2 = 1.0$ seconds. (b) Determine the current in the coil if the resistance is 10 Ohms. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law}
In the previous example, what would happen if the area $A$ of the loop were increased?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: The current would decrease.
\item B: The current would stay the same.
\item C: The voltage would decrease.
\item D: The voltage would increase.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law}
In the previous example, what would happen if the sign of the exponent in $B(t)$ were flipped?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: The current would reverse direction and increase in magnitude.
\item B: The current would reverse direction and decrease in magnitude.
\item C: The current would keep the same direction and increase in magnitude.
\item D: The current would keep the same direction and decrease in magnitude.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law}
In the previous example, what would happen if $\alpha$ in the exponent in $B(t)$ were increased?
\begin{itemize}

\item B: The current would reverse direction and decrease in magnitude.
\item C: The current would keep the same direction and increase in magnitude.
\item D: The current would keep the same direction and decrease in magnitude.

\textbf{Example:}
The square coil of Figure \ref{fig:loop2} has sides l = 0.25 m long and is tightly wound with N = 200 turns of wire. The resistance of the coil is R = 5.0 $\Omega$. The coil is placed in a spatially uniform magnetic field that is directed perpendicular to the face of the coil and whose magnitude is decreasing at a rate $dB/dt = −0.040 t$. (a) Graph the magnitude of the emf induced in the coil. (b) What is the magnitude of the current through the coil at 100 ms?

\item Show that power is equal to $P = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}$ for constant acceleration.
\item Show that the emf is $\epsilon = B l v$, from Faraday's Law.
\item Show that power generated, $P = I^2 R$, is equal to power injected.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law}
In the previous example, what would happen if $\vec{F}_a$ was pointed to the left?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: The current would reverse direction.
\item B: The current would keep the same direction.
\item C: The magnetic flux due to the external field would decrease.
\item D: A and C
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Faraday's Law}
In the previous example, what would happen if $R$ were increased, but the magnitude of $F_a$ were kept the same?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: The current would decrease.
\item B: The current would increase.
\item C: The current would remain constant.
\item D: The power required would increase.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Induced Electric Fields}

\begin{frame}{Induced Electric Fields}
Recall that the relationship between voltage and electric field is
\begin{equation}
\vec{E} = - \nabla V = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\hat{x}-\frac{\partial V}{\partial y}\hat{y}-\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}\hat{z}
\end{equation}
In one dimension, this becomes
\begin{equation}
\vec{E} = -\frac{dV}{dx}\hat{x}
\end{equation}
If we take a dot product with $- d\vec{x} = - dx ~ \hat{x}$ on each side, we find
\begin{equation}
-\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{x} = dV
\end{equation}
Integrating, we have
\begin{equation}
V = - \int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{x}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Induced Electric Fields}
However, if the voltage is a result of a changing magnetic field, and Faraday's Law, then
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\phi_m}{dt} = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{x}
\end{equation}
Recall that from \textit{electrostatics},
\begin{equation}
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{x} = 0 \label{eq:cons}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:cons} is true for eletrostatics because the Coulomb force is \textbf{conservative}.  But in a previous example we showed that power was being generated and \textit{conserved}, despite the fact that magnetic flux is changing.  What is happening?

\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the E-field outside the solenoid?
\item What is the E-field inside the solenoid?
\item Create a graph of the E-field strength versus distance.
