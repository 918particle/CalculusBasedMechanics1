\begin{abstract}
The concepts of calculus-based electromagnetism will be presented within the context of interactive problem-solving.  The course will begin with the concepts of electric charge, electrostatics, electric potential and applications to DC circuits.  The course will proceed with the addition of magnetism, induction, and AC circuits, and conclude with geometric and wave optics.  As time permits, some selected topics from quantum mechanics and special relativity will be introduced.  The course work will include interactive computational exercises, analytic textbook problems, group-designed projects, and lab-based activities.

\textit{\textbf{Grading}: There will be three tests, each examining conceptual understanding in step-by-step problems. Each
midterm is worth 15\% of the final grade. The weekly online homework is worth 20\% of the grade. Interactive
in-class activities will be worth 10\% of the final grade. Lab groups will present results of a group project worth 10\% of the grade.  The final exam will be held on May 10th, 13:00-15:00, and will be worth 15\% of the grade.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Grade Settings}: $<60\%$ = F, $\geq 60\%, <70\%$ = D, $\geq 70\%, <80\%$ = C, $\geq 80\%, <90\%$ = B, $\geq 90\%, <100\%$ = A.  Pluses and minuses: 0-3\% minus, 3\%-6\% straight, 6\%-10\% plus (e.g. 79\% = C+, 91\% = A-)} \\
\textit{\textbf{Homework Sets}: Typically 5-10 problems per week, assigned and collected on Mondays.  See \url{http://goeta.link/USB06CA-E19C6C-1SO} for online homework setup.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Bonus Essay}: Students may submit an essay on the history of scientific developments covered in the course, due at
the end of the semester. The essay must be 10 pages, address scientific arguments and results, and must include
references. The grade of this paper will replace the lowest midterm grade, if it would raise the final grade.} \\
