\begin{abstract}
The concepts of thermodynamics and calculus-based electromagnetism will be presented within the context of interactive problem-solving.  The course will begin with the concepts of heat and temperature, and the laws of thermodynamics.  Next, the concepts of electric charge, electrostatics, electric potential and applications to DC circuits will be covered.  The course will proceed with the addition of magnetism, induction, and AC circuits, and conclude with geometric and wave optics.  As time permits, some selected topics from quantum mechanics and special relativity will be introduced.  The course work will include interactive computational exercises, analytic textbook problems, group-designed projects, and lab-based activities.
