\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The concepts of calculus-based electricity, magnetism, and thermodynamics will be presented within the context of interactive problem-solving.  The course will begin with the concepts of electric charge, electrostatics, and electric potential.  Following electrostatics, applications to DC circuits will be covered.  The course will proceed with the addition of magnetism, induction, and AC circuits.  The course continues with geometric and wave optics, and concludes with an introduction to thermodynamics and statistical physics.  The course work will include interactive computational exercises, analytic textbook problems, group-designed projects, and lab-based activities.
