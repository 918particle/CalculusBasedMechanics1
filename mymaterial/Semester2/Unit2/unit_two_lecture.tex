James Prescott Joule first published in December 1840, an abstract in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, suggesting that heat could be generated by an electrical current. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed mass of water and measured the temperature rise due to a known current flowing through the wire for a 30 minute period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was proportional to the square of the current multiplied by the electrical resistance of the immersed wire. \\ \vspace{0.5cm} Wikipedia: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating}.

\section{The First Law of Thermodynamics}

\begin{frame}{The First Law of Thermodynamics}
\alert{Equation of state}: The equation of state of a system, in general, looks like this:
\begin{equation}
f(p,V,T) = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item $V$ is an \textbf{extensive} variable.
\item $p$ and $V$ are \textbf{intensive} variables.
\item Holding \textit{intensive} variables constant, doubling the mass of a system doubles the volume.  That is the relationship between intensive and extensive variables.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The First Law of Thermodynamics}
\alert{The equation of state of an ideal gas} looks like this:
\begin{equation}
pV - nRT = 0
\end{equation}
Which of the following is correct?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: The extensive variables are $p$, $V$, and $R$
\item B: The only extensive variable is $n$, and $p$, $V$, and $T$ are the intensive ones
\item C: The only extensive variable is $n$, and $p$ is the only intensive one
\item D: There are no extensive variables because none of them is mass
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The First Law of Thermodynamics}
Recall that the definition of work done on a system is:
\begin{equation}
W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{x}
\label{eq:work}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\vec{F}$ is the net force acting on the system
\item $d\vec{x}$ is the incremental displacement
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The First Law of Thermodynamics}
Example: suppose the force is gravity, near the surface of the Earth $\vec{F} = -mg \hat{y}$, and an object at height $h$ is released.
\begin{equation}
W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{x} = -mg \hat{y} \cdot -h\hat{y} = mgh
\label{eq:work2}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\vec{F}$ is the net force acting on the system
\item $d\vec{x}$ is the incremental displacement
\item Work-energy theorem can give the final speed: $\frac{1}{2}mv_{\rm f}^2 = mgh$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The First Law of Thermodynamics}
Definition of work, applied to a thermodynamic system \textit{with an equation of state}:
\begin{equation}
W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{x} = \int p\vec{A} \cdot d\vec{x} = \int p dV
\label{eq:work3}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\vec{A}$ and $d\vec{x}$ assumed to be parallel
\item $p$ is constant over $d\vec{x}$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The First Law of Thermodynamics}
Definition of work, applied to a thermodynamic system \textit{with an equation of state}:
\begin{equation}
W = \int p dV
\label{eq:work4}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Group board exercise:} Substitute the Ideal Gas Law into Eq. \ref{eq:work4}, to derive the work done \textit{when temperature is constant and $V$ is the independent variable}. \\ \vspace{0.5cm}
\textit{Hint: the integral of $\frac{1}{x}$ is $\ln x + C$.} \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Group board exercise:} Repeat, but at \textit{constant pressure} instead of constant temperature, again with $V$ as the independent variable.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The First Law of Thermodynamics}
The van der Waals \textit{equation of state} is: 
\begin{equation}
\left(p+\frac{a}{V^2}\right)\left(V-b\right) - nRT = 0
\label{eq:vanDerWaals}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Group board exercise:} Substitute this equation of state into Eq. \ref{eq:work4}, to find the work done by isothermal expansion.  Compare to the isothermal result from the Idea Gas Law, and recover the previous result for $W$ by setting $a$ and $b$ to zero.

How much energy is available to do work, in the form of heat?  (For example, if we expand a gas at constant pressure, by how much can we decrease the temperature?) \\ \vspace{0.5cm}
Recall from the prior chapter that 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
E_{\rm int} = \frac{3}{2}nRT = \frac{3}{2}nN_{\rm A}k_{\rm B}T = \frac{3}{2}NkT}
\label{eq:internal}

\section{Heat Capacities of an Ideal Gas}

\begin{frame}{Heat Capacities of an Ideal Gas}
\small What follows is a traditional proof of the following theorem:
\begin{equation}
C_{\rm P} = C_{\rm V} + R
\end{equation}
\textit{The molar heat capacity of a gas at constant pressure is always larger than at constant volume.} \\ \vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Assume} an ideal gas
\item \textbf{Apply} First Law of Thermodynamics
\item Evidence for \textit{independence of state function}
\item Evidence for \textit{kinetic theory of gases}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Heat Capacities of an Idea Gas}
\small
The first law of thermodynamics: $dE = dQ - dW$.  Consider an ideal gas, in a vessel with fixed volume.  Since $dW = pdV$, $dW=0$.  If heat $dQ$ is added to that vessel, the corresponding temperature in increase is
\begin{equation}
dQ = n C_{\rm V} dT
\end{equation}
where $C_{\rm V}$ represents the \textit{heat capacity at constant volume} \footnote{Recall that from kinetic theory, for ideal gases with no molecular interactions, $C_{\rm V} = \frac{3}{2}R$.}.  Because $dE = dQ$,
\begin{equation}
dE = n C_{\rm V} dT
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Heat Capacities of an Idea Gas}
\small
Consider the same gas, but at fixed pressure.  Beginning with first law of thermodynamics now accounts for work: \\ $dE = dQ - dW = dQ - pdV$.  If heat $dQ$ is added to the vessel, the corresponding temperature change is
\begin{equation}
dQ = n C_{\rm P} dT \label{eq:dq}
\end{equation}
where $C_{\rm P}$ is the \textit{heat capacity at constant pressure.}  In order to obtain an expression for $dE$ involving only temperature, the ideal gas law must be differentiated:
\begin{align}
d(pV) &= d(nRT) \\
pdV &= nRdT \label{eq:pdv}
\end{align}
Substituting the right-hand side of Eq. \ref{eq:pdv} for $dW$ in the First Law, and the right-hand side of Eq. \ref{eq:dq} for $dQ$ in the first law, the result is
\begin{equation}
dE = n(C_{\rm P} - R)dT
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Heat Capacities of an Idea Gas}
The expressions for $dE$ under isobaric and isochoric conditions have been obtained:
\begin{align}
dE &= C_{\rm V} dT \\
dE &= n(C_{\rm P} - R)dT
\end{align}
If the internal energy of a thermodynamic system depends only on the temperature, then these two expressions must be equal.  Upon setting them equal, a fundamental relationship is revealed:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
C_{\rm P} = C_{\rm V} + R}
\end{equation}
It has been shown that $C_{\rm V} = \frac{3}{2}R$ from the equipartition principle, so $C_{\rm P} = \frac{5}{2}R$ for an ideal gas.

\section{Adiabatic Processes with an Ideal Gas}

\begin{frame}{Adiabatic Processes with an Ideal Gas}
\textbf{\alert{Adiabatic}} describes a process in which no heat is exchanged, $dQ = 0$.  From the first law of thermodynamics,
\begin{equation}
dE_{\rm int} = -dW
\end{equation}
\textit{Free expansion} is used in the text to refer to the special adiabatic case in which $dW = 0$, so $E_{\rm f,int} = E_{\rm i,int}$.  More interesting is to consider the two forms of heat capacity, of the previous section, corresponding to isobaric and isochoric processes.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Adiabatic Processes with an Ideal Gas}
\small What follows is a traditional proof of the following theorem: \\ \vspace{0.5cm}
Let $\gamma = \frac{C_{\rm P}}{C_{\rm V}}$.  During an adiabatic process, the following quantity remains constant:
\begin{equation}
pV^{\gamma} = const
\end{equation}
\textit{The produce of the pressure and volume to a fixed power remains constant during an adiabatic process.} \\ \vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Assume} an ideal gas
\item \textbf{Apply} First Law of Thermodynamics
\item Evidence for \textit{independence of state function}
\item Evidence for \textit{kinetic theory of gases}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Adiabatic Processes with an Ideal Gas}
Consider an \textit{adiabatic} process ($dQ=0$) in which the First Law of Thermodynamics becomes
\begin{equation}
dE_{\rm int} = -dW = -pdV
\end{equation}
For any ideal gas, the internal energy is proportional to the temperature, regardless of the process type.  Thus,
\begin{equation}
dE_{\rm int} = n C_{\rm V} dT
\end{equation}
Substituting into the First Law and rearranging,
\begin{equation}
dT = -\frac{pdV}{n c_{\rm V}} \label{eq:t1}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Adiabatic Processes with an Ideal Gas}
\small
As before, differentiating the the idea gas law, assuming both pressure and volume may vary, yields
\begin{equation}
dT = \frac{dp V+pdV}{nR} \label{eq:t2}
\end{equation}
Equating these two expressions for $dT$, Eq. \ref{eq:t1} and Eq. \ref{eq:t2}, gives 
\begin{equation}
C_{\rm V} V dp + \left( C_{\rm V} + R \right) p dV = 0 \label{eq:almost}
\end{equation}
Recall that $C_{\rm V} + R = C_{\rm p}$.  Using this, Eq. \ref{eq:almost} becomes
\begin{equation}
C_{\rm V} V dp + C_{\rm p} p dV = 0 \label{eq:almost2}
\end{equation}
Letting $\gamma = \frac{C_{\rm p}}{C_{\rm V}} > 1$, Eq. \ref{eq:almost2} reads
\begin{equation}
V dp + \gamma p dV = 0 \label{eq:gamma}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Adiabatic Processes with an Ideal Gas}
Rearranging Eq. \ref{eq:gamma} and integrating both sides,
\begin{align}
\int \frac{dp}{p} + \gamma \int \frac{dV}{V} &= 0 \\
\ln p + \ln V^{\gamma} &= const \\
\ln pV^{\gamma} &= const \\
pV^\gamma &= const
\end{align}
Thus, the theorem holds:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ pV^\gamma = const}
\end{equation}

The reason this result is important is now we have a way to describe adiabatic transitions on $pV$ diagrams.

With an understanding of $pV$ behavior of different processes, and the First Law, we can begin to construct more complex processes, and predict the work done, and heat required.

We have seen how \textbf{cyclic} processes have $dE_{\rm int} = 0$, so $dQ = dW$ by the First Law.  However, we need to introduce \textit{how} to calculate the $dQ$ to perform a given process, so that we may know the predicted work to be done. \\ \vspace{0.5cm}
\textit{Isothermal process, ideal gas}:
\begin{align}
dQ &= dW \\
dQ &= pdV \\
dQ &= \frac{nRT dV}{V} \\
\int dQ &= \int \frac{nRT dV}{V} \\
Q &= nRT \ln\left(\frac{V_{\rm f}}{V_{\rm i}}\right)
\end{align}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Adiabatic Processes with an Ideal Gas}
Heat required to change the volume of an idea gas isothermically:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{Q = nRT \ln\left(\frac{V_{\rm f}}{V_{\rm i}}\right)} \label{eq:isoT}
\end{equation}
We can repeat this procedure for adiabatic processes:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{Q = \frac{k}{1-\gamma}\left(V_{\rm f}^{1-\gamma} - V_{\rm i}^{1-\gamma}\right)} \label{eq:ad}
\end{equation}
In Eq. \ref{eq:ad}, $k = p_{\rm i}V_{\rm i}^\gamma$.  The utility of these formulae: \alert{we can predict the heat required to go from one known state to another}.  The isobaric and isochoric processes are much simpler, but the derivation is similar.
