\section{Vectors and Newton's Laws}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\vec{F}_{\rm 1} = -\frac{3}{2}\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}$ N, and $\vec{F}_{\rm 2} = -2\hat{x} + \frac{3}{2}\hat{y}$ N.  a) Give the magnitude of each force.  b) What is the net force?  c) What is the angle between these two forces? \vspace{2.0 cm}
\item Imagine you are sitting in an airplane that has just lifted off with an acceleration vector 45 degrees with respect to horizontal.  Draw a free-body diagram corresponding to you, showing all forces acting on you.

\item The plane reaches a constant altitude and begins flying at a constant speed.  Then, the plane pilot banks in a turn, introducing centripetal acceleration.  Draw a free-body diagram corresponding to you, showing all forces acting on you.
