\begin{frame}{What is a force, in practice?}
A force has units of \textit{Newtons}, just like distance has units of \textit{meters}.  One Newton is the force required to make an object of mass 1 kilogram accelerate by 1 m/s$^2$.\\
\vspace{1cm}
A force must also be a \textit{vector}: if a force acts on a system in a certain direction, the object will accelerate in that direction. \\
\vspace{1cm}
Force has to be related to mass in some way.

\begin{frame}{What is a force, in practice?}
\textbf{Lab activity}: Force, mass, and stretched springs.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Obtain a set of weights, a force-meter (spring), and a ruler.
\item Hang a weight from the spring, and measure the extra distance the spring stretches.
\item Repeat with different weights, recording the stretched distances alongside the weights.
\item Compute the ratio of the mass of the weight to the stretched distance in each case.  What is the result?
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is a force, in practice?}
Thus, if a force causes \textit{a system with some mass} to accelerate, the force must be \textit{proportional to that mass}.  \alert{``If it is heavier, we mush push it harder, to obtain the same acceleration.''}  \\
\vspace{1cm}
Now, let's consider all the systems for which we have described the \textit{kinematics}, where we made no use of the concept of a force...
\end{frame}

\section{Newton's First Law}

\begin{frame}{Newton's First Law}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=red!40!blue,title=Newton's First Law]
\alert{A body at rest remains at rest or, if in motion, remains in motion at constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.}
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Newton's First Law}
\small
For most people in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Newton's First Law was not intuitive.  ``When have you ever seen a thing move perpetually?''\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
The key is the last phrase: ``\textit{...unless acted on by a \alert{net} external force}.''  Nothing moves unless forced, and if the \alert{net} force is zero, the velocity does not change.  Thus, if some object has a constant velocity, then it remains at that velocity unless some force (friction, air-resistance, gravity, a wall) interrupts. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}

Write down your observations about the net force on the object.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Newton's First Law}
\small
\textbf{Lab activity}: Force tables
\begin{enumerate}
\item Obtain a set of weights, and a force-table, with ring and pulley system.
\item Using knowledge of vectors, arrange weights on the pulleys such that the ring remains stationary in the center.
\item Double one of the weights, and find the angles the strings must make to keep the ring stationary in the center.
\item Define the force vectors as vectors with magnitudes equal to the masses of the weights, in the directions of the strings.  Do the vectors add to zero?
\item Why does the ring remain stationary even though there are three forces from strings acting on it?
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Newton's First Law}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/Table.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:table} The force table setup includes a wheel with angles, strings and pulleys, and a central ring.}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Newton's First Law}
Newton's First Law may be thought of in terms of the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{F_{\rm net} = \sum_{\rm i} \vec{F}_{\rm i} = 0}
\label{eq:firstlaw}
\end{equation}
In the case of the force table ring, $\vec{F}_{\rm i} \neq 0$ but $\vec{F}_{\rm net} = 0$, so we observe no velocity.  We can also have a situation with constant velocity and $\vec{F}_{\rm net} = 0$  but $\vec{F}_{\rm i} \neq 0$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Newton's First Law}
A man slides a palette crate across a concrete floor of his shop.  He exerts a force of 60.0 N, and the box has a constant velocity of 0.5 m/s.  What force cancels his pushing force, and what is the magnitude of that force?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: wind, 60.0 N
\item B: friction: 60.0 N
\item C: friction: -60.0 N
\item D: weight: -60.0 N

\textit{Newton's First Law and Inertial Reference Frames}.  If an object has a constant velocity in one frame of reference, it has a constant velocity in another frame of reference moving at a constant velocity with respect to the first frame.  Consider the prior problem, and a second man is walking in the opposite direction as the palette crate at a speed of 1 m/s.  What is the speed of the palette crate from his perspective?  What is the first man's force on the palette crate from his perspective?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: 1.5 m/s, 60.0 N
\item B: 1.5 m/s, -60.0 N
\item C: 0.5 m/s, 0.0 N 
\item D: -1.5 m/s, -60.0 N
\end{itemize}

\section{Newton's Second Law}

\begin{frame}{Newton's Second Law}
From the prior problem, we see that \alert{Newton's First Law} holds even under relativity, for inertial reference frames.  Let's assume we observe a system from an intertial reference frame. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Let us also ignore any \textit{internal forces}: forces components of the system apply to each other.  Focusing on the external forces only, we make the following two observations: \\

Indiana Jones is running through the rainforest, and he wades into a pit of quicksand.  He has a mass of 70 kg, however the normal force is only 400.0 N.  He pushes forward with a force of 250.0 N, and the quicksand sucks him backwards with a force of 50.0 N.  What is the net force on Indiana?  The force of gravity is his mass times $g$, in the downward direction.

\begin{frame}{Newton's Second Law}
Notice that if we define $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$, we may write \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_{\rm net} = \frac{d\vec{p}_{\rm net}}{dt} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m \vec{a}_{\rm net}

\vspace{0.5cm}
In words: the force is the derivative of the \textit{momentum}, $\vec{p}$.

\begin{frame}{Newton's Second Law}
A particle of mass $m$ is falling under the influence of gravity, but experiences a thrust force upwards: $\vec{F}_{\rm t} = kt$, making the net force $\vec{F}_{\rm net} = kt - mg$.  Express the velocity as a function of time, assuming the velocity is $v_{\rm 0}$ at $t=0$.
\begin{itemize}
\item A: $v(t) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{k}{m} t^2+v_{\rm 0}$
\item B:  $v(t) = \frac{k}{m} t - gt$
\item C:  $v(t) = \frac{k}{m} t - gt +v_{\rm 0}$
\item D: $v(t) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{k}{m} t^2 - gt +v_{\rm 0}$

We will return to the concept of \textit{momentum} in the next few chapters...

\begin{frame}{Newton's Second Law}
There is a difference between \alert{\textit{mass}}, and \alert{\textit{weight}}.  \textit{Mass} is proportional to the number of atoms in an object.  \textit{Weight} is a force derived from Newton's second law (mass times acceleration), assuming the acceleration due to gravity is constant.  If an object has a mass of 1 kilogram, and the Earth's gravitational acceleration is $\approx 10$ m/s$^2$, then it \textit{weighs} $\approx 10.0$ N (10.0 kg m/s$^2$).

Astronauts are walking on the moon, and lifting moon rocks into cannisters.  On Earth, the cannisters weighed 40.0 N each, and each astronaut is expected to carry two of them, loaded each with 65.0 kg of moon rock.  The acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is about 17\% of that on Earth.  What weight are these astronauts expected to carry?

\begin{frame}{Newton's Third Law}
As mentioned before, the \textit{weight} of an object is $\vec{w} = -mg\hat{y}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, pointing in the $-\hat{y}$ direction.  A stack of three books rests on a table.  Each book weighs 12.0 N.  If the books are not moving, what force is the table exerting on the books, from Newton's third law?

\item C: -36.0 N
\item D: 36.0 N
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Newton's Third Law}
When Newton's third law indicates that the weight of an object is couterbalanced by a surface, we call the counterbalancing force the \alert{normal force}: $\vec{N} = mg\hat{y}$.  What is the normal force exterted by the middle book in the stack?  What is the normal force extered by the bottom book?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: 12.0 N, 24.0 N

Two more example forces: \textbf{\alert{tension}}, and the \textbf{\alert{spring force}}.  Tension is the force found in pulling an object.

The spring force has a simple expression (Hooke's Law):
\begin{equation}
\vec{F} = -k\vec{x}
\label{eq:spring}
\end{equation}
In Eq. \ref{eq:spring}, $\vec{x}$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position of the spring.  So if a spring (or any other system with this property) has a rest length of $L$, the force is $-k\Delta x$ if the system is stretched to a length $L+\Delta x$. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
The restoring force is interesting for many reasons, including the fact that it leads to \textit{simple harmonic motion} (address this in the future).

A person uses a slingshot to launch a water balloon horizontally from a height of 1.0 m.  The slingshot acts as a spring, with $\vec{F} = -k\Delta x$, and $k=1000.0$ N/m.
