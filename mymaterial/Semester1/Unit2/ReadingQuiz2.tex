\begin{enumerate}
\item An airplane flying horizontally with a speed of 140 m/s at a height of 800 m drops a crate of supplies.  If the parachute fails to open, how far in front of the release point does the crate hit the ground? \\ \vspace{5cm}
\item Suppose the airplane in the preceding problem instead launches the crate horizontally in its direction of motion at a speed of 100 m/s in addition to the speed of the plane.  Where will the crate land?
\end{enumerate}
