\begin{abstract}
The goal of this project was to predict the trajectory of a rocket based on energy conservation.  The report and presentation were thorough at every stage of the analysis.  The report includes example calculations, quantitative hypotheses, assessment of systematic errors, and a clear conclusion.

\textit{Project Assessment}
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
\1 Introduction of Concepts, Hypothesis
\2 This was clear and detailed.
\1 Explanation of the Experiment, with Diagram or Picture
\2 This was clear and detailed.
\1 Presentation of Data and Systematics
\2 There were several systematics, including wind and consistent delivery of force from three books at once.
\1 Conclusion
\2 The conclusion stuck to the data and assessed errors.  Statistically, I agree that the hypothesis was confirmed.
