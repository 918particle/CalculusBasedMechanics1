\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The concepts of calculus-based mechanics will be presented within the context of interactive problem-solving.
First, the concepts of displacement, velocity, and acceleration in one and two dimensions will be introduced, build-
ing up to Newtonâ€™s Laws of motion. Next, the concepts of friction and rotational motion will be added. More complex
problems will be introduced through the conservation of energy and linear momentum, followed by the rotational
equivalents. The course work will include interactive computational exercises, analytic textbook problems, and
lab-based activities.
