\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The concepts of calculus-based electromagnetism will be presented within the context of interactive problem-solving.  The course will begin with the concepts of electric charge, electrostatics, electric potential and applications to DC circuits.  The course will proceed with the addition of magnetism, induction, and AC circuits.  The course will conclude with the electromagnetic spectrum and electromagnetic waves, time permitting.  The course work will include analytic textbook problems, interactive computational exercises, group-designed projects, and lab-based activities.

\textit{\textbf{Pre-requisites}: Calculus I (MATH141) (may be concurrent).} \\
\textit{\textbf{Course credits, Liberal Arts Categorization}: 4 Credits, COM1} \\
\textit{\textbf{Regular course hours}: Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 15:00 - 16:30 in SLC 228} \\
\textit{\textbf{Instructor contact information}: jhanson2@whittier.edu, tel. 562.907.5130} \\
\textit{\textbf{Office hours}: Mondays, 16:30-17:30, and Tuesdays from 13:00-16:00 in SLC 212.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Attendance/Absence}: In-class activities will serve as attendance (see \textbf{Grading}). Students needing to reschedule
midterms and exams should notify the professor a reasonable time beforehand}.\\ 
\textit{\textbf{Late work policy}: Acceptance of late work is left to the discretion of the instructor.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Text}: University Physics Volume One - \url{https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1}} \\
\textit{\textbf{Grading}: There will be three tests, each examining conceptual understanding in step-by-step problems. Each test is
worth 15\% of the final grade. The weekly online homework is worth 20\% of the grade. Interactive in-class activities will be worth 10\% of the final grade. Lab groups will present results of a group project worth 10\% of the grade. The final exam will be held on December 10th from 13:00-15:00, and will be worth 15\% of the grade.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Grade Settings}: $<60\%$ = F, $\geq 60\%, <70\%$ = D, $\geq 70\%, <80\%$ = C, $\geq 80\%, <90\%$ = B, $\geq 90\%, <100\%$ = A.  Pluses and minuses: 0-3\% minus, 3\%-6\% straight, 6\%-10\% plus (e.g. 79\% = C+, 91\% = A-)} \\
\textit{\textbf{Homework Sets}: Typically 10 problems per week, assigned on Monday and collected the following Monday. Please follow the link \url{http://goeta.link/USB06CA-9A264D-1X1} to access the online homework system. The system requires \$32.50 for access (remember that the textbook is free). The online system will give clues to struggling students and provide the professor with useful class statistics to aid in class management.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Bonus Essay}: Students may submit an essay on the history of scientific developments covered in the course, due at
the end of the semester. The essay must be 10 pages, address scientific arguments and results, and must include
references. The grade of this paper will replace the lowest midterm grade, if it would raise the final course grade.} \\
\textit{\textbf{ADA Statement on Disability Services}: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please contact Disability Services: disabilityservices@whittier.edu, tel. 562.907.4825.} \\
