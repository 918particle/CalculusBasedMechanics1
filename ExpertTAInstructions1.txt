Hi Seamus & Jordan,

I will send a separate email to Jordan with an instructor login and password, plus some general tips using the system as an instructor.

See below for the class registration details you can each provide your students.  I also attached a registration PDF for each of your classes, which you might decide to share with your students at the start of the semester.  In the document, I include the class registration link, step-by-step instructions for each of the registration pages, our 24x7 contact details for student support, and a link to the OpenStax University Physics Vol 1 textbook page.  By the way, you may notice a class code is no longer needed to start the registration, as it is included in the registration URL to save students an extra step at the start of the signup process.

Each of you has access to each other's classes.  I put a tutorial assignment into both classes, which is something we recommend you have students complete at the beginning of the semester, so they have some familiarity with how the program works.  I put each of your last name's next to your class name, just to make sure it is 100% apparent, which specific class you are looking at and working in.  I can shuffle your class order, if either of you have a personal preference on how you want them to show up in your account.  And I think that's about it for now.  Please call, text, or email if you have any questions at all.

We look forward to working with you both this fall.

Best Regards,
