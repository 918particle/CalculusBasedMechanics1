\item A $5\times 10^5$ kg rocket is accelerating straight up.  The thrusters produce an upward force of $1.25 \times 10^7$ N, and the force of air resistance is $4.5 \times 10^6$ N downward.

\item A football player with mass 70 kg pushes on a player with mass 90 kg.  (a) According to Newton's 3rd law, if the first player exerts a force of 700 N on the second player, what is the force the second player exerts on the first player? \\ \vspace{1cm}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose you have a 120-kg wooden crate resting on a wood floor. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction are 0.5 and 0.3, respectively.  (a) What maximum force can you exert horizontally on the crate without moving it? (b) If you continue to exert this force once the crate starts to slip, what will the magnitude of its acceleration then be? \\ \vspace{2.0cm}

\item Two race car drivers routinely navigate a turn as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:race}.  (a) Which path may be taken at a higher speed, if both paths correspond to the same force of friction and centripetal force? (b) Suppose path 1 has a radius of curvature of 400 m, and path 2 has a radius of curvature of 800 m.  The coefficient of friction is 1.0.  If the force of friction balances the centripetal force, what are the tangential velocities of each race car? \\ \vspace{1cm}

\item \textbf{Two bonus points:} The existence of the dwarf planet Pluto was proposed based on irregularities in Neptune’s orbit. Pluto was subsequently discovered near its predicted position. But it now appears that the discovery was fortuitous, because Pluto is small and the irregularities in Neptune’s orbit were not well known. To illustrate that Pluto has a minor effect on the orbit of Neptune compared with the closest planet to Neptune, (a) calculate the acceleration due to gravity at Neptune due to Pluto when they are $4.5 \times 10^{12}$ m apart, as they are now.  The mass of Pluto is $1.4 \times 10^{22}$ kg.  (b) Now calculate the acceleration due to gravity at Neptune due to Uranus, presently about $2.5 \times 10^{12}$ m apart, and compare it with that due to Pluto.  The mass of Uranus is $8.62 \times 10^{25}$ kg. \\ \vspace{1cm}
