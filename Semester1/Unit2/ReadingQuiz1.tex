\begin{enumerate}
\item $y(t) = -\frac{1}{2}g t^2 + v_{i,y} t + y_i$ ... Accelerating system vertically.
\item $x(t) = v_{i,x} t + x_i$ ... Constant velocity horizontally.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Kinematics in 2D and 3D}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Imagine a system propagating through 3D space with a velocity vector $\vec{v} = (2t-1)\hat{i} + 2\hat{j} + (-3t+2)\hat{k}$.  (a) Is the object accelerating?  Why or why not? (b) Write the acceleration vector by taking the derivative. \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item Suppose a system is thrown into the air, accelerating downwards due to gravity, but proceeding horizontally at constant velocity.
\begin{itemize}
\item Modify the $y(t)$ and $x(t)$ equations in the memory bank to include the fact that the system starts at the origin, so $y_i = 0$ and $x_i = 0$ for $t = 0$. \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Solve the $x(t)$ equation for $t$: \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Substitute $t$ into the $y(t)$ equation, to obtain a function like $y(x)$: \\ \vspace{1.5cm}
\item Let $v_{i,x} = v_i \cos\theta$, and $v_{i,y} = v_i \sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle of the throw relative to the ground. \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Solve the quadratic equation $y(x)$ to find where $y = 0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
