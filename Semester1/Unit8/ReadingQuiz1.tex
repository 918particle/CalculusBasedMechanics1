\begin{itemize}
\item $F = -\frac{dU}{dx}$ ... 1D definition of a conservative force.
\item Note: Net work is zero along a closed path for a conservative force.
\item $dF_x/dy = dF_y/dx$ for conservative forces.
\item $\vec{p} = m \vec{v}$ ... Definition of momentum.
\item $\vec{p}_f = \vec{p}_i$ ... Momentum conservation: no net forces.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conservative Forces}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine if each of the following forces are conservative.  \textit{Hint: Draw each of them in a 2D coordinate system.}
\begin{itemize}
\item A: $\vec{F} = F_0 \hat{i}$
\item B: $\vec{F} = F_0 \hat{j}$
\item C: $\vec{F} = A x \hat{i} + B y \hat{j}$
\item D: $\vec{F} = B x \hat{i} + B y \hat{j}$
\end{itemize}
\item Consider the 2D potential $U(x,y) = k(x^2 + y^2)$.  (a) What is the associated force? (b) Where is the force zero? (c) What is the potential energy at $(2,-2)$?  (d) If a system is released from $(2,2)$, what will be the kinetic energy at the origin? \\ \vspace{2cm}

\section{Momentum}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A gas molecule has a mass of $20 \times 10^{-25}$ kg and an average speed of 350 m/s.  What is the momentum in kg m/s? \\ \vspace{1cm}

\end{figure}
\item Suppose this molecule collides with the side of the glass beaker, turns around, and flies off in exactly the opposite direction at the same speed.  What is the \textit{change} in momentum, $\Delta \vec{p} = \vec{p}_f - \vec{p}_i$?  (This is how we build up the \textbf{kinetic theory of gases} in Physics 3...stay tuned). \\ \vspace{1cm}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Momentum Conservation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two molecules collide and stick together, forming one larger molecule.  Each molecule weighs $20 \times 10^{-25}$ kg.  One has a velocity of 350 m/s, and the other has a velocity of -350 m/s.  (a) What is the total initial momentum (adding the two momenta)? (b) What is the final speed of the big new molecule?
\end{enumerate}
