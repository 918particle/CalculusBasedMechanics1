\section{Chapter 1 - Units and Measurement}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In your own words, what is a physics theory, and what determines the validity of a theory? \\ \vspace{0.5cm}
\item Which of the following is not correct?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: The quantity meters per second$^2$ is a unit of acceleration.
\item B: A kilometer is a unit of speed.
\item C: A kilometer per hour is a unit of speed.
\item D: The quantity kg per meter$^3$ is a unit of density.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 2 - Vectors}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which of the following is should be considered a vector quantity (i.e. having a magnitude and direction)?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: wind velocity
\item B: air temperature
\item C: the mass of an object
\item D: the brightness of a light source
\end{itemize}
\item Explain in your own words (or draw a diagram): why can't a vector have a component greater than its own magnitude?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Calculus Topic - The Derivative}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textit{derivative}, or slope of a function $f(t)$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
f'(t) = \lim_{dt \to 0} \frac{f(t+dt) - f(t)}{dt}
\end{equation}
What do you think the \textit{limit} means, in your own words?  Evaluate the limit: $\lim_{x \to \infty} \left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)$. \vspace{1cm}
\item Find the derivative of the following function: $f(t) = 4t - 2$. \vspace{1cm}
\item (With professor): determine a procedure for taking the derivative of $f(t) = a t^n + b$.
\end{enumerate}
