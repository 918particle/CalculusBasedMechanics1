\section{Memory Bank}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ ... Average velocity.
\item $x(t) = v t + x_i$ ... Position versus time with constant velocity.
\item $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ ... Acceleration is the change in velocity.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 2 - Graphical Analysis of Kinematics}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the motion of the system depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:1} (Left).  What is the speed of the system?  Suppose the system is moving in the positive y-direction.  What is the expression of the velocity? \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Write an equation for the position of the system in Fig. \ref{fig:1} (Left) versus time.  Where will the system be at 18 seconds? \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Consider the motion of the system in Fig. \ref{fig:1} (Right).  Find the change in velocity between points P and Q.  Calculate the acceleration.  \textit{Hint: pay attention to units.}
\end{enumerate}
